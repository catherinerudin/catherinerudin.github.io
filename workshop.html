<p>An important question about ellipsis concerns the processes by which ellipsis is resolved. This question can be broken down into two parts: the nature of the antecedent accessed during resolution and the nature of the ellipsis site itself. These have been termed the resolution question and the structure question, respectively[1]. The present project concerns the nature of the ellipsis site (i.e. the structure question); does material that has gone missing at ellipsis sites contain silent syntactic structure, or is it a semantic representation devoid of syntax[2]?
We investigate this question for Noun Phrase Ellipsis (NPE). In NPE, a noun phrase is elided, as seen in (1).</p>

<p>(1) Bob walked Sue's [dog] and Mary walked John's &lt;dog&gt;.</p>

<p>In order to answer the structure question, a syntactic representation must be distinguished from a semantic one. These representations will differ as to what they encode. For example, a syntactic representation contains morpho-syntactic features, but a semantic one does not. We exploit this difference between the representations and use Agreement Attraction (AA) to probe its nature. AA is a process which is sensitive specifically to the morpho-syntactic feature of number[3-5]. AA occurs when the verb incorrectly agrees with a piece of structure that intervenes between the verb and the grammatical controller of agreement, (2).</p>

<p>(2) They key to the cabinets are on the table.</p>

<p>Due to its sensitivity to number features, AA can be used as a diagnostic for the nature of the representation at ellipsis sites. Complex NPs which trigger agreement can be placed in a configuration where they are antecedents for NPE to see if AA occurs after the ellipsis site, (3).</p>

<p>(3) Scarlett's [key to the cabinets] got lost, but Chelsea's &lt;key to the cabinets&gt; {was/were} on the table. </p>

<p>If AA occurs after the ellipsis site, this suggests that the representation at the ellipsis site is syntactic; only in the case that the representation encodes number features would AA be possible. If the representation is semantic, no AA would be predicted as this representation does not encode the necessary number features.</p>

<p>In a series of online reading time experiments, we use AA to diagnose the nature of the representation at the ellipsis site in NPE. We first illustrate that complex NPs do generate AA when in a possessive structure without ellipsis. When these same NPs are elided, AA is not seen. There is, however, still sensitivity to the number mismatch between the grammatical controller and agreeing verb. Thus, we conclude that there is partial, but not full, reactivation of a syntactic representation at ellipsis sites. The head is reactivated, along with its number features, capturing the grammaticality mismatch but lack of AA effects.</p>

<p>Discussed are how these results from a language processing experiment may inform theory, specifically, syntactic and semantic theories of ellipsis and also reactivation.</p>

  Eliciture</i><br/>(joint work with <a
  href="http://aardvark.ucsd.edu/">Jonathan Cohen</a> and <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/">Hannah Rohde</a>)<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> <a href="javascript:unhide('andy')">(click

<div id="andy" class="hidden"><div class="bodytext1"><p>Whereas sentence (1a) states that the employee was fired and was embezzling money, it also strongly invites the inference that the employee was fired because of the embezzling.   An analogous inference is lacking in (1b), however: one does not normally infer that the firing was caused by the employeeâ€™s hair color.   And sentence (1c) leads to a counter-to-expectation inference, leading one to wonder why an employee with so many accolades would be let go.  </p>

<p>(1a) The boss fired the employee who was embezzling money. <br/>        
(1b) The boss fired the employee who has red hair.  <br/> 
(1c) The boss fired the employee who won numerous corporate awards. </p>

<p>We posit that these inferences do not follow directly from the procedures that have been argued to underlie other sorts of pragmatic enrichment, such as from a violation of communicative (e.g., Gricean) norms based on principles of rationality/cooperativity (as in IMPLICATURE), or the need to complete/expand a proposition so as to appropriately fix truth-conditional content (as in Bach's IMPLICITURE).   We argue instead that they follow from more basic, general cognitive (not specifically linguistic) strategies for building mental models of the world that draw on types of experiential knowledge and associative principles that are known to be used to establish the coherence of passages across clauses.  </p>

<p>For want of a term of art, we brand the phenomenon as ELICITURE, selected to capture the fact that a speaker, by choosing a particular form of reference, intends to elicit such associative inferences on the part of her hearer.  The importance of accounting for such inferences goes beyond the recovery of implicit communicated content; it is also crucial for the interpretation of explicit linguistic expressions.  As an example, we present a case study that examines pronoun interpretation.  A passage completion experiment was conducted using stimuli like (1a-b) as context sentences, presented to participants with or without an additional pronoun prompt.  Whereas accounts of pronoun interpretation that appeal primarily to surface-level contextual factors find little to distinguish contexts (1a-b), a Bayesian analysis (Kehler et al. 2008; Kehler & Rohde 2013) predicts a difference, through an interconnected chain of referential and coherence-driven dependencies. The results confirm that pronoun interpretation biases, but not production biases, are sensitive to whether or not an implicit cause can be inferred from a relative clause, revealing precisely the asymmetry predicted by the Bayesian analysis.</p></div>

   <p><strong>Mission:</strong><br/>
   The workshop will address questions such as: how can formal semantics be reconciled with or imported into broader theories of cognition? How can linguistic semantics be imported into all-purpose cognitive models? How can research on language processing and cognitive modeling inform theoretical work in semantics?</p>
